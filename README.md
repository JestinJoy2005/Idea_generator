# Startup Idea and Pitch Generator using LaMini-Flan-T5

## Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered Startup Idea & Pitch Generator** that uses a **Transformer-based language model** to generate startup ideas based on a user-specified domain (e.g., Fintech, Agritech, EdTech).
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to produce structured startup pitches, including a **Business Idea**, **Problem Statement**, and **Solution**. The model is deployed with **Gradio** for an interactive web interface.

## Workflow

### 1. Model and Libraries

* The project uses the **LaMini-Flan-T5-783M** model from Hugging Face, a fine-tuned version of the **Flan-T5** model optimized for text generation tasks.
* The **Transformers**, **Torch**, and **Accelerate** libraries handle model loading, inference, and computation optimization.
* **Gradio** provides a user-friendly web interface for interaction.

### 2. Input and Processing

* The user inputs a domain such as “Fintech,” “Agritech,” or “Healthcare.”
* A structured **prompt** is automatically created with clear instructions to the model:

  * Business Idea
  * Problem Statement
  * Solution
* The model processes the input and generates a coherent startup pitch relevant to the given domain.

### 3. Output

* The output includes:

  * **Business Idea** – A brief description of the proposed startup.
  * **Problem Statement** – The key issue the startup aims to solve.
  * **Solution** – How the startup addresses the problem effectively.
* The text is generated dynamically with creativity and domain relevance.

## Techniques Used

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Text-to-Text Generation
* Transformer Architecture (LaMini-Flan-T5)
* Prompt Engineering
* Interactive Web Deployment using Gradio
